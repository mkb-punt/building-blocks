# Best Practices (Delete these when copying into new Building Block)

# name should be short and contain the name of the component used. Example: Article Card, Social Sharing Buttons

# tags should be minimal but descriptive. Make sure to use a tag that matches the component used. Example: If your component used off-canvas and buttons then tag: off-canvas, button

# category needs to match one of the main categories for your component to show. Navigation, status, media, containers, forms, control

# description should describe what the Building Block is, what it can be used for or use cases, and any special instructions to use it or interact with it.

# versions describe what versions of Foundation this component should work on. If you are not sure about older versions, specify only the version you built it with.

# author describes yourself. Your GitHub username goes here, twitter handle so we can give you a shoutout and of-course your name.

# containerClass can be used to inject a wrapper for your Building Block to present it better. The example here will center the Building Block and keep the width to 6 columns wide.

# requirements for the component to work as expected, see https://github.com/zurb/building-blocks/issues/211
